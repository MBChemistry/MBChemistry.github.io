Introduction
======
The drug design process requires a medicinal chemist to not only consider the properites of a compound that alter the therpeautic activity of a compound, but also the pharmacological properties of how a compound behaves in the body, commonly known as the properties affecting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME). These ADME characteristic define the bioavailbility of a given drug.

Typically, most drugs going to market are required to be orally bioavailable. This is often predicted in the early stage of the design design process by well-known 'rule of thumb' approaches, such as Lipinski's rule of 5 criteria.
