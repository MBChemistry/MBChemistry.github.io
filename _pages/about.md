Introduction
======
The drug design process requires a medicinal chemist to not only consider the properites of a compound that alter the therpeautic activity of a compound, but also the pharmacological properties of how a compound behaves in the body, commonly known as the properties affecting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME). These ADME characteristic define the bioavailbility of a given drug.

Typically, the majority drugs going to market are required to be orally bioavailable. This is often predicted in the early stage of the design design process by well-known 'rule of thumb' approaches, such as Lipinski's rule of 5 criteria, and later filters such as the Veber, Ghose, and Mugge filters. Although they are useful methods for the identification of orally bioavaible compounds, over-reliance on these filters has lead to an over-restriction of chemical space for small molecules, and although fairly accurate for identifying orally bioavaible compounds, they are notably weaker at accurately identifying compounds with poor oral bioavaibility.

Our goal was to develop a quantifiable metric to identify pre-exsisting compounds with a high likelihood of poor oral bioavailbility, in order to create a library of small molecules with high gut residence.

Fructose Malabosorption
======
The goal of our discovery of non-systemic drugs is to identify suitable candidates for the treatment of Fructose Malabsorption, a condition related to the body's inability to absorb an excess of fructose in the small intestine, leading to symptoms commonly associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It is known that the phenylboronic acid functional group is able to bind to fructose, and we aim to develop a library of non-sytemic fructose scavengers for the treatment of fructose malabsorption.
